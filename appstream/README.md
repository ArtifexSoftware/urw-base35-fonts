## What is AppStream?
"AppStream is a cross-distribution effort for enhancing the way we interact with the software repositories provided by (Linux) distributions by standardizing software component metadata.

It provides the foundation to build software-center applications, by providing
metadata necessary for an application-centric view on package repositories.

AppStream additionally provides specifications for things like an unified
software metadata database, screenshot services and various other things needed
to create user-friendly application-centers for (Linux) distributions."

### NOTE:
The `de.urwpp.URWCoreFontSetLevel2.metainfo.xml` does not have a corresponding
font family per se. Instead, it can be used to provide a way how to install all
the 35 base fonts of (URW)++ Core Font Set [Level 2] at once, which should
enhance users' experience.
